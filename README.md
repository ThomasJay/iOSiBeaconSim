# iOSiBeaconSim
Simple iOS iBeacon Simulator

Compile this with XCode and run on your device.

You can change the UUID, Major and Minor numbers in the AppDelegate.m file at the top.

This can be used on iPhone, iPod or iPad.

Try using this with my "Locate" iOS app.

The iBeacon is broadcasting only while the app is in the foreground, it stops inthe background.

Let me know if you have any quesitons.

Thanks, Tom
